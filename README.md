Abstract

Sentiment analysis is a popular technique used by businesses to monitor brand and product performance. It is useful for detecting positive or negative sentiments toward a product based on customer feedbacks. In most cases, classification of sentiment is categorized into two or three classes. In this paper, the target classes are defined by the total number of star ratings present in Amazon reviews, on a scale of one to five. As a global leader in the ecommerce industry, Amazon considers customer satisfaction to be one of its core values. Therefore, it will not only be beneficial to extract sentiment polarity of the reviews, but also to identify the aspects being discussed for low rating reviews. Some examples of aspects include shipping, specific product qualities, prices, and packaging. This project applies text mining techniques, both supervised and unsupervised, to dissect the sentiments (predict star rating) toward Amazon’s Grocery and Gourmet Food Department as well as to identify topics within negative sentiments.


Introduction

In recent years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become an active area of research for extracting insightful information from text data. NLP is a computerized approach to understand the human language in its natural speech or text form. It encompasses numerous techniques to parse, clean, and interpret texts. One major application of NLP is Sentiment Analysis, the computational study of people’s opinions, attitude, and emotions toward an entity. Sentiment Analysis is a classification approach to detect the polarity and subjectivity in opinions regarding an event, topic, or experiences. In this digital world with abundant options, product reviews play an important role in consumer decision behavior. A product with many positive reviews can provide justification product quality. Therefore, extracting sentiment information from product reviews is valuable for both businesses and consumers to gauge market response and take necessary actions for improvement. In addition,clustering techniques can be applied to conclude aspects or topics being discussed in the reviews. This is the process of opinion mining or opinion summarization.
